By using this website and downloading content provided by **Andirz**, you agree to the following terms. 

---

## 1. Distribution & Re-uploads
As noted in our general policy, **do not re-upload** my mods to other websites, file hosts, or mirrors.
* Please always link directly to this official website if you wish to share my work.
* Re-uploads are prohibited because they make it impossible for me to provide support, track bugs, and keep the content updated.
* To ensure your game stays safe and functional, only use official download links to avoid outdated files or malware.

## 2. Translations & Collaboration
* I truly appreciate any help with translations or improvements to existing ones.
* If you want to share a translation, you are allowed to distribute **pure STBL files (string tables)** only.
* You may **not** include or redistribute my original package or script files within your translation upload.
* To coordinate quality control and stay in touch, please join my **Discord server** if you wish to collaborate.

## 3. Support & Warranty
* Creating and maintaining mods requires a lot of time and energy, so all content is provided "as is."
* Support can only be guaranteed for files that were downloaded directly from my **Patreon** or **CurseForge** page.

## 4. Compliance with EA Policy
* All custom content is published in accordance with the [EA Custom Content Policy](https://help.ea.com/en/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/the-sims-4-mods-policy).
* My work is provided for free and strictly complies with EA's Positive Play rules.
