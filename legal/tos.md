## 1. Distribution & Re-uploads
As noted in our general policy, **do not re-upload** my mods to other websites, file hosts, or mirrors. 
* Always link directly to this official website for downloads.
* Re-uploads are prohibited because they hinder my ability to provide support, track issues, and maintain the content properly.
* Downloads from third-party sites may contain malware or outdated files; please use official links for your safety.

## 2. Translations & Collaboration
* I welcome assistance with translations or improvements to existing ones.
* To ensure proper coordination and quality control, please join my **Discord server** if you wish to collaborate.

## 3. Support & Warranty
* Creating and maintaining mods requires significant time and energy.
* All content is provided "as is." Support is only guaranteed for files downloaded directly from this site or official mirrors like CurseForge.

## 4. Compliance with EA Policy
* All custom content is published in accordance with the [EA Custom Content Policy](https://help.ea.com/en/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/the-sims-4-mods-policy).
* My work is provided for free and complies with EA's Positive Play rules.
