*Mods can enhance your Sims 4 experience by adding new content, features, and customizations. By following these guidelines, you can enjoy a secure and enjoyable modding experience.*

## 1. Enable Mods in the Game
To use mods in *The Sims 4*, you must first enable them in the game settings, as they are disabled by default:

1. Launch the game and open the **Options** menu.
2. Navigate to **Game Options** > **Other**.
3. Check **Enable Custom Content and Mods** (for `.package` files).
4. Check **Script Mods Allowed** (for `.ts4script` files).
5. **Restart the game** for the changes to take effect.

> **Note:** Major game patches may automatically disable these settings. Remember to check them after an update.

## 2. Find and Download Mods
Always download mods from **reputable sources** to ensure safety and compatibility:
* Use trusted platforms like **CurseForge** or the official websites/blogs of creators.
* Avoid "collector" sites that redistribute mods without permission, as they often host outdated files.

After downloading, extract compressed archives (`.zip`, `.rar`) using tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip.

## 3. Placing Mods in the Mods Folder
Place your extracted files into the following directory:
`Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods`

### Folder Structure Rules:
* **.package files:** Can be placed in subfolders for organization (e.g., `Mods/Clothing`).
* **.ts4script files:** These must **not** be nested more than **one subfolder deep** (e.g., `Mods/ModName/script.ts4script` is fine, but `Mods/Folder1/Folder2/script.ts4script` will not work).

## 4. Final Tips for a Smooth Experience
* **Backup your saves:** Always create a backup before adding or updating mods.
* **Keep mods updated:** Outdated mods are the most common cause of bugs and crashes.
* **Read instructions:** Some mods require specific Game Packs or other mods (dependencies) to function.

## 5. Security Awareness
* **Script Mods (`.ts4script`):** These are executable Python programs. Download them only from authors you trust to avoid malware.
* **Package Files (`.package`):** These do not execute code and are generally safe to use.
