# What is a Script Mod?

Unlike simple "Tuning Mods" that only change XML values, a **Script Mod** (like my *Smart Core Script*) uses Python code to inject new logic into the game.

- **Capabilities:** They can add brand new menus, interactions, and systems that didn't exist before.
- **Requirement:** You must have "Script Mods Allowed" enabled in your Sims 4 settings.
- **File Extension:** These mods always come with a `.ts4script` file.
