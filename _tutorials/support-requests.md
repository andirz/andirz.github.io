If you are experiencing issues with any of my mods, I am here to help! To provide you with the fastest and most accurate assistance, please follow these guidelines when submitting a support request.

## Before You Submit a Request

Before reaching out, please ensure you have performed the following basic troubleshooting steps:

1.  **Check the [Mod Status Dashboard](/status/):** Ensure the mod you are using is marked as "Compatible" or "Updated" for the current game patch.
2.  **Update the Mod:** Make sure you have the absolute latest version of the mod installed.
3.  **Check Dependencies:** Double-check if the mod requires other scripts (like **Smart Core Script**) or specific DLCs to function.
4.  **Clear Game Cache:** Delete the `localthumbcache.package` file from your `The Sims 4` folder.
5.  **Test Without Other Mods:** Try running the game with *only* the problematic mod and its requirements to rule out conflicts with other creators' content.

## Where to Get Support

The best and fastest way to receive support is through my official **Discord Server**. Using Discord allows for easier file sharing (like logs) and real-time communication.

* **Discord:** [Join the Andirz Mods Discord](https://discord.com/) (Link zu deinem Discord einfügen)
* **Alternative:** You can also report issues on the specific mod page on **CurseForge** via the comments or "Issues" tab.

## What to Include in Your Request

To help me diagnose the problem, please provide as much information as possible. A good support request includes:

### 1. Clear Description of the Issue
What exactly is happening? When does it happen? (e.g., "The game crashes when I click on the SimSim Online Store on the computer").

### 2. Your Environment
* **Game Version:** (e.g., 1.110.xxx)
* **Mod Version:** (e.g., 1.2.5)
* **Installed DLCs:** Mention if you are missing any packs required by the mod.

### 3. Log Files (Crucial for Script Mods)
If you are reporting a script error or a crash, please attach the following files found in your `The Sims 4` folder:
* `LastException.txt`
* `LastUIException.txt`
* Any log files generated by the mod itself (e.g., `Andirz_SmartCore_Log.txt`).

### 4. Screenshots or Video
Visual evidence is incredibly helpful. Take a screenshot of the error message or a short video of the glitch occurring.
