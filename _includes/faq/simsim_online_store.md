\### FAQ – SimSim Online Store



\*\*How do I install the mod?\*\*

Please follow the \[general tutorial on mod installation](https://andirz.io/tutorials/installation). Make sure that script files are not placed deeper than one subfolder.



\*\*What are the requirements?\*\*

To function properly, the mod requires both the \*\*PSO Common Package\*\* and the \*\*Smart Core Script\*\*. The Lot51 Core Library is no longer needed.



\*\*Are there known conflicts?\*\*

The mod is designed to be standalone and does not overwrite any game resources. It is compatible with other shopping or delivery mods. Always ensure the required libraries are up to date to avoid issues.



\*\*Why is the selection in the app limited?\*\*

The store adapts to your installed content. If you only have the Base Game, you will see fewer items. As you add more DLCs or supported Custom Content, the assortment will automatically expand.



\*\*Is Custom Content (CC) supported?\*\*

Standard CC objects are often supported and manually added by ID. However, \*\*custom recipes\*\* are currently not supported due to technical limitations and inconsistent tagging by other creators.



\*\*Why is there no mail delivery?\*\*

Items are added directly to your Sim's inventory. Mailbox delivery is technically restricted by the game and would require manual overwrites for hundreds of objects, which is not a priority at this time.



\*\*The interactions are missing – what should I do?\*\*

Check if your Sim has access to a phone, computer, or tablet. If the menu is still missing, ensure the required libraries (PSO Common \& Smart Core) are installed correctly and that you are on the latest game version.
