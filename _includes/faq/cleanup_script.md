\## FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions



\*\*Does this script work on macOS or iMac?\*\*

No. This is a Windows batch script (.bat) and cannot run on macOS or iMac systems.



\*\*Does this script delete save files or mod settings?\*\*

No. The script does \*\*not\*\* delete save games, households, lots, or configuration files from other mods. It only removes \*\*temporary cache data and diagnostic log files\*\* that the game automatically recreates.



\*\*Can this script break my game?\*\*

No. Deleting cache files is safe and recommended after updates or mod changes. The game will automatically regenerate everything it needs on the next launch.



\*\*When should I run this script?\*\*

Typical use cases:

\- After a game update

\- After installing or removing mods

\- If you experience lag, UI glitches, or strange errors

\- When preparing log files for troubleshooting



\*\*The script opens and closes very quickly – is that normal?\*\*

Yes. If there is nothing to delete, the script may finish almost instantly.



\*\*Why does Windows warn me about file deletion?\*\*

No. That warning is expected and intentional. The entire purpose of this script is to delete temporary cache and log files. If you feel unsure, you can simply open the .bat file in any text editor (for example Notepad). You will see that it only deletes the explicitly listed cache folders and log files — nothing else.
