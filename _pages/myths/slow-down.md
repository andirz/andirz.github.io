title: "Modding Myth #1: Script Mods Slow Down Your Game"

This is probably the most common myth in The Sims 4 modding community. Script Mods are often blamed for performance issues simply because they sound more technical than package mods.



\## The myth

“Script Mods make the game slower, especially if you use many of them.”



\## Why people believe this

Players notice lag after installing mods and assume scripts must be the cause. Since Script Mods are less transparent, they become an easy explanation.



\## What’s actually true

Script Mods do not run permanently by default. Performance issues usually come from poor design, excessive event listeners, or logic that triggers far too often. A well-written Script Mod with clean architecture can have no noticeable impact at all.



\## What you should take away

Script Mods are not the problem. Bad code is.
