title: "Modding Myth #3: All Mods Break After Every Patch"

Patch days often cause panic, leading players to delete all mods immediately.



\## The myth

“Every patch breaks all mods.”



\## Why people believe this

Major updates \*can\* break mods, and negative experiences spread faster than calm explanations.



\## What’s actually true

Many mods are patch-neutral. Small tweaks, tuning-only mods, and well-isolated Script Mods often continue to work without changes. Only mods that rely on altered game systems usually need updates.



\## What you should take away

Wait for confirmation before deleting everything. Not every patch is a disaster.
