Many players believe that installing more than one Script Mod will inevitably break their game.



\## The myth

“You should only use one Script Mod at a time.”



\## Why people believe this

Early modding advice tried to simplify troubleshooting. Over time, this turned into a rigid rule that stuck.



\## What’s actually true

Script Mods don’t conflict just because they are scripts. Conflicts happen when two mods modify the same systems in incompatible ways. You can safely use many Script Mods as long as they don’t overlap logically.



\## What you should take away

Compatibility depends on scope and design, not on the number of Script Mods.
