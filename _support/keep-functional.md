*Maintaining your mods is just as important as installing them. Outdated or conflicting mods can lead to game crashes, visual glitches, and corrupted save files. Follow this guide to ensure your modded game stays stable.*

## 1. Keep Your Mods Updated
The Sims 4 is frequently updated with new features, bug fixes, and expansion packs. These game updates often change the underlying code, which can break existing mods—especially **script mods**.

* **Check after every Patch:** Every time EA releases a game update, check the websites or Discord servers of your favorite mod creators for updates.
* **Remove "Broken" Mods:** If a mod is reported as "broken" after a patch, remove it from your `Mods` folder immediately until an update is available.
* **Use a Mod Manager:** Tools like the *CurseForge App* or *Sims 4 Mod Manager* can help you keep track of updates for many popular mods automatically.

## 2. Dealing with Game Patches
When a major game patch is released, it is a good practice to:

1.  **Backup your Save files:** Copy your `Saves` and `Tray` folders to a safe location (like your Desktop or an external drive) before updating the game.
2.  **Move your Mods folder:** Move your `Mods` folder to the Desktop before launching the game for the first time after a patch.
3.  **Test the Game:** Run the game without mods to see if it's stable.
4.  **Reintroduce Mods gradually:** Add your mods back one by one (or in small batches), starting with the ones you've confirmed are updated or compatible.

## 3. The 50/50 Method for Troubleshooting
If your game starts acting up (crashing, UI glitches, or infinite loading screens) and you don't know which mod is the cause, use the **50/50 Method**:

1.  Divide your `Mods` folder into two halves.
2.  Place one half back into the game and test.
3.  If the issue occurs, the "bad" mod is in that half. If not, it's in the other half.
4.  Repeat this process with the problematic half until you've narrowed it down to the single broken file.



## 4. Clear Your Cache Regularly
Sometimes, old data stored in the game's cache can cause issues even after you've updated or removed a mod. Periodically delete these files from your `Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4` folder:

* `localthumbcache.package` (Safe to delete, the game will regenerate it)
* The contents of the `cache` folder (but keep the folder itself)
* The contents of the `onlinethumbnails` folder

## 5. Pay Attention to Dependencies
Many mods require other files to work, such as:
* **XML Injector:** Used by many "tuning" mods to add new interactions.
* **Smart Core Script:** Required for many of my own mods (Andirz).
* **Specific DLCs:** Some mods only work if you own a certain Expansion or Gameplay Pack.

**Always read the requirements section** on the mod download page before installing!
