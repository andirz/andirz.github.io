## Before You Submit a Support Request

Before reaching out for support, please make sure you have completed the following **basic troubleshooting steps**. This helps avoid unnecessary back-and-forth and ensures issues can be resolved faster.

### Basic Checks
- **Check the Mod Status Dashboard**  
  Verify that the mod is marked as **Compatible** or **Updated** for the current game patch.
- **Update the Mod**  
  Make sure you are using the **latest available version** of the mod.
- **Check Dependencies & DLC Requirements**  
  Confirm that all required scripts (e.g. *Smart Core Script*) and necessary DLCs are installed.
- **Clear the Game Cache**  
  Delete the `localthumbcache.package` file from your *The Sims 4* folder.
- **Disable OneDrive (if used)**  
  OneDrive syncing can interfere with mods. Ensure your Sims 4 folder is not managed by OneDrive.

### Rule Out Mod Conflicts
Before asking for help, ensure the issue is **actually caused by this mod** and not by conflicts with other mods or game settings.

- **Test with Only This Mod**  
  Run the game using *only* the problematic mod and its required dependencies.
- **Identify the Source via Logs**  
  Check error log files for script names or folder paths that indicate which mod is causing the issue.
- **Confirm Game Version**  
  Make sure your game is fully up to date. Outdated game versions can cause unexpected errors.
- **Search for Existing Solutions**  
  Check Google, forums, Discord servers, and mod comment sections to see if the issue has already been reported and solved.

### When You Are Ready to Ask for Help
If you are confident the issue is caused by this mod, please include the following information in your request:

- A **clear and detailed description** of the problem
- Your **game version** and **mod version**
- Relevant **error logs** (if available)
- A list of **troubleshooting steps** you have already tried

The more complete your report is, the faster and more accurately the issue can be identified and resolved.

## Where to Get Support

The best and fastest way to receive support is through my official **Discord Server**. Using Discord allows for easier file sharing (like logs) and real-time communication.

* **Discord:** [Join the Andirz Mods Discord](https://discord.com/) (Link zu deinem Discord einfügen)
* **Alternative:** You can also report issues on the specific mod page on **CurseForge** via the comments or "Issues" tab.

## What to Include in Your Request

To help me diagnose the problem, please provide as much information as possible. A good support request includes:

### Clear Description of the Issue
What exactly is happening? When does it happen? (e.g., "The game crashes when I click on the SimSim Online Store on the computer").

### Your Environment
* **Game Version:** (e.g., 1.110.xxx)
* **Mod Version:** (e.g., 1.2.5)
* **Installed DLCs:** Mention if you are missing any packs required by the mod.

### Log Files (Crucial for Script Mods)
If you are reporting a script error or a crash, please attach the following files found in your `The Sims 4` folder:
* `LastException.txt`
* `LastUIException.txt`
* Any log files generated by the mod itself (e.g., `Andirz_SmartCore_Log.txt`).

### 4. Screenshots or Video
Visual evidence is incredibly helpful. Take a screenshot of the error message or a short video of the glitch occurring.
