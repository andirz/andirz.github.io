## 💡 Recommended Software
These desktop applications provide the stability and power needed for serious development. They are the backbone of a professional modding workflow for handling complex data and file structures locally on your machine.

* **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** – A professional-grade IDE specifically designed for Python development. It offers deep code analysis, integrated debugging, and large-scale project management, making it essential for complex scripting and logic development.
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** – A versatile, lightweight code editor with a massive ecosystem of extensions. It is the perfect all-rounder for handling both XML tuning and Python scripts within a single, highly customizable and fast workspace.
* **[Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/)** – The primary utility for game modding. This tool is mandatory for package management, creating tuning overrides, and extracting game assets like 3D models or textures for further modification and exploration.
* **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** – The industry-standard open-source 3D creation suite. It is essential for creating custom meshes, animations, and poses, and integrates directly with other modding tools to ensure seamless asset importing and exporting.

## 🛠️ Development & Scripting
Managing code and comparing data structures are daily tasks in modding. These web-based tools streamline the workflow and ensure accuracy when updating files for new game patches and versions.

* **[Frankk's Tools](https://frankkmods.com/#/tools)** – A suite of specialized web utilities designed to automate the more tedious parts of mod development. These tools include templates and automation scripts that significantly speed up the development cycle.
* **[STBL Editor](https://stbl.sims4toolkit.com/)** – Managing String Tables (STBL) is crucial for mod accessibility and localization. This editor simplifies the process of creating and exporting in-game text without the need for manual and error-prone hex-code management.
* **[TDESC Browser](https://tdesc.lot51.cc/)** – A fundamental resource that allows modders to search through official game engine documentation. It is the most effective way to understand how specific XML attributes and engine logic triggers actually function.
* **[S4TK (Sims 4 Toolkit)](https://sims4toolkit.com/)** – A collection of low-level tools for advanced modders. It provides specialized libraries that help with complex file manipulation and generating unique IDs for custom mod components and game resources.
* **[Text-Compare](https://text-compare.com/)** – A lightweight and extremely fast utility for identifying differences between text blocks. It is ideal for quick "sanity checks" on code snippets or when comparing strings for consistency across different versions.
* **[Mergely](https://editor.mergely.com/)** – A sophisticated browser-based diff and merge tool. It is particularly useful when comparing large XML tuning files or identifying specific changes between different iterations of scripts in a side-by-side view.

## 🐍 Python Decompilers
Since the game engine utilizes Python, understanding the underlying scripts is key. These tools help reverse-engineer bytecode to understand how core systems interact and how to properly hook custom functionality.

* **[Decompiler.com](https://www.decompiler.com/)** – A reliable, multi-purpose online decompiler that handles compiled Python files effectively. It serves as a solid fallback tool if other specialized utilities struggle with specific bytecode structures or versions.
* **[ToolNB PYC Decompiler](https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html)** – A fast and straightforward web utility for quick bytecode lookups. It is ideal when you need to understand a specific function in a script mod instantly without setting up a complex local environment.
* **[LDDGO Decompiler](https://www.lddgo.net/en/string/pyc-compile-decompile)** – A versatile suite for both compilation and decompilation of Python strings and files. This is particularly useful for testing how Python code translates into bytecode and analyzing existing script behavior.

## 🎨 Icons & Assets
Visual identity is what makes a mod stand out. These resources provide the high-quality building blocks for professional-looking UI elements, custom in-game menus, and immersive graphical components.

* **[Icons8](https://icons8.com/)** – A comprehensive source for high-quality, professionally designed icons. The extensive library ensures a consistent aesthetic across complex UI projects, which is vital for maintaining a clean and modern look.
* **[Freepik Icons](https://www.freepik.com/icons)** – A massive database of vector icons and graphics for finding inspiration or base elements. These assets can be further customized to create unique in-game interactions and custom menu designs.
* **[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)** – A reliable repository of royalty-free stock images and vector assets. It is ideal for finding realistic textures or background graphics that require safe, high-quality content for public mod releases.
* **[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)** – A powerful, cloud-based image editor for quick asset adjustments directly in the browser. It is perfect for resizing UI elements or handling transparency settings without needing to launch heavy desktop software.

## 📚 Community & Documentation
The shared knowledge of the community is often the most valuable asset. These links connect you to the latest technical discussions, compatibility standards, and official development hubs.

* **[EA Forums](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-mods-and-custom-content-en)** – The official hub for technical discussions and troubleshooting. It is a vital place for staying informed about engine changes and discussing modding issues directly with other developers.
* **[Scarlet's Realm](https://scarletsrealm.com/the-mod-list/)** – The industry standard for tracking mod compatibility. This resource is essential for checking if community mods are broken or need updates after an official game patch has been released.
* **[SimTimes](https://www.simtimes.de/)** – One of the leading German news sources for all things Sims. It provides detailed coverage of game updates, patch notes, and community news, which is helpful for staying informed on game changes.
* **[Sims Community](https://simscommunity.info/)** – A major news and resource hub providing up-to-date information on game updates, patches, and features. It is a valuable source for understanding new mechanics that might require mod adjustments.
