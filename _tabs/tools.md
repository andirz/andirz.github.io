This page serves as a comprehensive directory of the essential tools and resources I utilize during the development of my mods. Whether you are looking for technical utilities to handle Python scripts or creative assets for UI design, this list covers the core pillars of modern Sims 4 modding.

## 🛠️ Development & Scripting
Managing code and comparing data structures are daily tasks in modding. These tools streamline the workflow and ensure accuracy.

* **[Mergely](https://editor.mergely.com/)** – A sophisticated browser-based diff and merge tool. It is particularly useful when comparing large XML tuning files or different iterations of Python scripts. It allows for side-by-side visualization of code changes, making it easy to spot missing tags or syntax errors after a game update.
* **[Text-Compare](https://text-compare.com/)** – A lightweight and extremely fast utility for identifying differences between two text blocks. I often use this for a quick "sanity check" on snippets of code or when comparing translated strings to ensure consistency across localized versions.
* **[STBL Editor (Sims 4 Toolkit)](https://stbl.sims4toolkit.com/)** – Managing String Tables (STBL) is crucial for mod accessibility. This web-based editor simplifies the process of creating, editing, and exporting localized text without manual hex-code management.
* **[TDESC Browser (Lot51)](https://tdesc.lot51.cc/)** – The Tuning Description (TDESC) browser is a fundamental resource. It allows modders to search through the official game engine's documentation for XML attributes to understand how game logic is triggered.
* **[S4TK (Sims 4 Toolkit)](https://sims4toolkit.com/)** – A collection of low-level tools for modders, including specialized editors and libraries that help with file manipulation and generating unique IDs for mod components.

## 🐍 Python Decompilers & Scripting Tools
Since The Sims 4 runs on Python, understanding the underlying game scripts is key to creating advanced functionality.

* **[PyLingual](https://pylingual.io/)** – Currently one of the most advanced online decompilers available. It supports modern Python versions (3.10+) and is highly effective at reconstructing complex logic with clean, readable output.
* **[Decompiler.com](https://www.decompiler.com/)** – A reliable, multi-purpose online decompiler that handles `.pyc` and `.pyo` files effectively. It’s a great fallback if other tools fail.
* **[ToolNB PYC Decompiler](https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html)** – A fast web utility for quick bytecode lookups when you need to understand a specific function in a script mod instantly.
* **[LDDGO Decompiler](https://www.lddgo.net/en/string/pyc-compile-decompile)** – A versatile suite for both compilation and decompilation of Python strings and files, useful for testing bytecode behavior.

## 🎨 Icons & Assets
Visual identity is what makes a mod stand out. These resources provide the building blocks for professional-looking UI elements.

* **[Icons8](https://icons8.com/)** – My primary source for high-quality, professionally designed icons. The extensive library ensures a consistent aesthetic across complex UI projects like the **P.S.O.** series.
* **[Freepik Icons](https://www.freepik.com/icons)** – A massive database of vector icons and graphics for finding inspiration or base elements that can be further customized.
* **[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)** – A reliable repository of royalty-free stock images and vector assets, ideal for realistic textures and background graphics.
* **[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)** – A powerful, cloud-based image editor for quick asset adjustments, resizing, and transparency handling directly in the browser.

## 📚 Community & Documentation
The shared knowledge of the community is often the most valuable asset for solving complex modding problems.

* **[Scarlet's Realm - The Mod List](https://scarletsrealm.com/the-mod-list/)** – The industry standard for tracking mod compatibility. Essential for keeping your own installation clean and checking if your mods need updates after a patch.
* **[EA Forums - Mods & CC](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-mods-and-custom-content-en)** – The official hub for technical discussions and staying informed about game engine changes that might affect mod stability.
* **[Frankk's Python Guides](https://frankkmods.com/#/guides/python)** – High-quality tutorials that explain the bridge between XML tuning and Python scripting in a way that is accessible to modders.

## 💡 Recommended Software
Desktop applications that provide the stability and power needed for serious development projects.

* **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** – A professional-grade IDE for Python. Essential for projects where code analysis, integrated debugging, and large-scale script management are required.
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** – A versatile code editor with a massive ecosystem of extensions, making it the perfect all-rounder for XML and Python.
* **[Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/)** – The "Swiss Army Knife" of modding. Mandatory for package management, tuning overrides, and extracting game assets.
* **[Frankk's Tools](https://frankkmods.com/#/tools)** – Specialized utilities designed to automate the more tedious parts of mod development, such as packaging and string management.
