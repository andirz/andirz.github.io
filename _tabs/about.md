## About Me

Hi, I'm **Andirz**! 

I am a **The Sims 4 Modder** specializing in technical gameplay enhancements, script systems, and UI improvements. My work focuses on making the game more intuitive, realistic, and feature-rich through advanced scripting.

### My Projects
I develop complex frameworks and gameplay mods that integrate deeply with the game's mechanics. Some of my most notable projects include:

* **Smart Core Script**: The technical backbone for many of my mods.
* **SimSim Online Store**: A complete overhaul of the in-game shopping experience.
* **Obscura Network**: Advanced social systems and networking features.
* **Better Pie Menu & Live Shopping**: Enhancing the user interface for a smoother flow.
