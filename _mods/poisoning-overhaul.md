## What does this mod do?

The **Poisoning Overhaul** makes the poisoning and antidote mechanics from *Jungle Adventure* more challenging and realistic. It introduces quality levels for antidotes and increases the danger of temple traps.

### Better Antidotes
- **Quality Matters:** Antidotes now have quality levels (Outstanding, Normal, Poor).
- **Effectiveness:** Only an Outstanding antidote guarantees a 100% cure rate. 
- **Risky Business:** Poor-quality antidotes have a 10% chance of causing instant death. Drinking two in a row is almost certainly fatal. Even Normal quality has a 0.5% death risk.
- **Side Effects:** Antidotes now have a bad taste, giving Sims a corresponding mood buff.
- **Visual Fix:** Empty glasses now correctly disappear after drinking.

### More Dangerous Temple Traps
- **Lethal Arrows:** Poison arrows in temples now cause instant death in 50% of cases.
- **Preemptive Protection:** Drinking an Outstanding antidote before entering can reduce the risk of immediate death by up to 15%.

## Manufacturing & Purchasing

- **Skill Barrier:** You can no longer buy antidotes on the computer if your Selvadoradian Culture knowledge is too low.
- **Rewards Store:** Antidotes remain available via the Reward Store for Satisfaction Points.
- **Herbalism Integration:** To craft your own antidotes, the *Selvadoradian Herbalism* mod is recommended.

## Death Logic & Exceptions

- **Immortal Sims:** Grim Reapers, Vampires, Robots, Ghosts, and immortal Werewolves are immune to death by poisoning.
- **Pregnancy:** By default, pregnant Sims are protected to remain compliant with certain platform policies. A separate add-on is available to enable this risk.

## Requirements

- **Lot51 Core Library** is strictly required for full functionality.
- **Expansion Packs:** Requires *Jungle Adventure (GP06)*.
- **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Translations

This mod exclusively uses existing strings from the game. No additional translations are necessary; it will automatically appear in your game's language.

## Compatibility

- Designed to be non-intrusive.
- No EA resources are overridden in the main mod.
- No compatibility issues with other major gameplay mods are expected.
