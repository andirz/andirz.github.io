## About This Mod

**Beach Yoga** allows Sims to practice yoga directly on the beach using beach towels.  
As a side effect, yoga mats can also be used as beach towels.

This mod was previously part of another project and has been slightly updated and released as a standalone mod for better visibility and maintenance.

## Gameplay Details

- Yoga can be performed **directly on beach towels**.
- Yoga mats can be used **as beach towels**.
- Fully integrated into existing yoga interactions.
- No custom UI and no custom strings.

## Important Notice – Beach Towel Game Bug

Due to a current EA bug, beach towels are not fully functional in the game.

To use this mod properly, you **must** install the **Beach Towel Fix** by Bienchen.  
For convenience, the fix is also provided here as a separate download.

Full credit goes to Bienchen for identifying and resolving this issue.
