## About This Mod

Tired of your Sims dreaming of stardom, enrolling in university for a Drama degree, and learning absolutely nothing about **Acting**? In the original game, the curriculum focuses heavily on Charisma and Comedy, forcing actors to take elective courses just to get basic experience.

This mod overrides four core courses from *Discover University's* Drama Degree and replaces the original skills with the **Acting Skill**. Now, your degree actually prepares you for the stage!

### Course Changes
In the original game, your Sims learn 5x Charisma, 5x Comedy, and 2x Fitness. My version balances this to **4x Charisma, 3x Comedy, 4x Acting, and 1x Fitness**.

| Course | Original Skill | New Skill |
|:-------|:---------------|:----------------|
| **Course A** | Charisma | **Acting** |
| **Course H** | Comedy | **Acting** |
| **Course J** | Fitness | **Acting** |
| **Course L** | Charisma | **Acting** |

*Note: No course content or descriptions have been changed. I only updated the assigned skills where they best fit the course context.*

## Two Mod Variants
There are two versions of this mod. **Please install only one!**

* **Variant A:** Requires the **Sims 4 Get Famous** Expansion Pack (uses EA Acting Skill).
* **Variant B:** Requires Sacrificial's **Road To Fame** mod (uses RTF Acting Skill).

Bonus for Variant B: I also replaced the EA Acting Skill in the *Acting Elective Course* with the Road To Fame Acting Skill. This allows you to take Acting as an elective even if you don't own the Get Famous EP!

## Compatibility
* **Discover University** Expansion Pack is **required**.
* **Get Famous** EP is recommended (for Variant A).
* **Road To Fame Mod** is required if you do not have Get Famous (for Variant B).

This mod overrides specific internal Tuning IDs. It will conflict with any other mod that modifies the same course resources:
* `university_CourseData_Drama_ClassA` (ID: 219446)
* `university_CourseData_Drama_ClassH` (ID: 219453)
* `university_CourseData_Drama_ClassJ` (ID: 219455)
* `university_CourseData_Drama_ClassL` (ID: 219457)
* `university_CourseData_Electives_Acting` (ID: 221989) — *Variant B only*
