## About This Mod

You played with a lot of custom personality traits and then deleted the corresponding mods, and now all of your 500 NPC Sims are empty? If this has happened to you, then this mod is for you! This mod will fill all of your Sims (active and NPCs) with **random personality traits** up to the maximum allowed (e.g., three for adults, two for teens). 

* **Smart Selection:** It uses all traits currently available in your game (both Vanilla and Custom).
* **Conflict Prevention:** It ensures that conflicting traits (like *Loner* and *Outgoing*) are not assigned to the same Sim.
* **Safety First:** If a Sim already has the maximum number of traits, the mod will do nothing.
