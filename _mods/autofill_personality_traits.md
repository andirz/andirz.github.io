## About This Mod

**Did you just purge your Mods folder only to find a world full of "blank" Sims?** When you remove custom personality traits from your game, it often leaves hundreds of NPCs with empty slots, sometimes leaving them with only a single trait. Manually fixing every Sim in your save is an impossible task. This mod provides a seamless, automated solution to restore life and variety to your world instantly.

### Key Features

This utility identifies any Sim with missing personality traits and populates those empty slots with random selections from your current trait pool.

* **Global Refresh:** Automatically processes both your **active households** and all **NPCs** across your entire save file.
* **Adaptive Filling:** The mod fills traits up to the **maximum allowed limit** for each specific Sim. Whether it’s the default EA limits or a limit expanded by other mods, this tool detects the available slots and fills them accordingly.
* **Full Integration:** It pulls from all traits currently available in your game, including **Base Game**, **DLC**, and any **Custom Traits** you still have installed.
* **Conflict-Free Logic:** Built-in checks ensure that conflicting traits are never assigned to the same Sim simultaneously.

### How It Works

* If a Sim already has their maximum number of personality traits, the mod **does nothing**. Your carefully designed Sims stay exactly as they are.
* For Sims with empty slots, traits are assigned randomly, bringing immediate diversity and fresh behavior back to your neighborhoods.
* Because it targets the "allowed maximum," it works perfectly alongside mods that increase the number of trait slots available for different age groups.
