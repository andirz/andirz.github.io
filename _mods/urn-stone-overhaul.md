> ### ⚠️ Mod Status: Broken
> This mod is currently **broken** after Patch 1.110 (Life & Death Preparation). Use with caution or wait for an update, as it overrides core urn and ghost interactions that were heavily changed by EA.

## About This Mod

The **Urn/Stone Overhaul** simplifies the management of deceased Sims and adds much-needed depth and realism to the process of releasing spirits. It removes unnecessary confirmation dialogs and introduces variety to how Sims react emotionally to death.

### Key Features:
* **Instant Destruction:** Urns and gravestones can now be destroyed immediately via a new "Destroy" interaction without needing to release the spirit first.
* **No Confirmation Dialogs:** Releasing spirits or destroying urns no longer triggers a "Are you sure?" pop-up. You know what you're doing!
* **Children can help:** Children (but not toddlers) are now able to release spirits and destroy urns—an interaction previously restricted by EA.
* **Inventory Management:** Empty urns or those containing ghosts can be destroyed directly from a Sim's inventory.
* **No Reaper Block:** You no longer have to wait for the Grim Reaper to leave the lot to manage urns or release spirits.

## Personalized Reactions
Instead of the standard "Sad +1" or "Happy +1" buffs, Sims now receive varied emotional outcomes when releasing a ghost. Depending on their relationship and traits, they may feel:
* **Energized +1**
* **Fine 0**
* **Sad +1, +2, or +3**

## Translations
This mod uses internal game strings only. It is **immediately available in all languages** supported by the game!

## Requirements
* **Lot51 Core Library** is strictly required for full functionality.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Compatibility & Overrides
This is an **override mod** and will conflict with any other mod that modifies the following resource:
* `urnstone_Release` (Super Interaction)
