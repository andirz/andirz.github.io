## About This Mod

**Write Skill Book** allows any Sim to write skill books once they meet the required skill levels — without being forced to complete a specific aspiration or permanently override game interactions.

In the vanilla game, only Sims with the **Chronicler (Professorial)** trait can write manuals. This trait is locked behind the *Renaissance Sim* aspiration, which makes little sense from a gameplay perspective. This mod removes that artificial limitation in a clean and non-invasive way.

## How it works

This mod does **not** overwrite any EA interactions.

Instead, it uses an activation system:

- Sims with at least  
  - **Writing Skill level 5**  
  - **Logic Skill level 2**  
  can unlock the **Skill Book Writing** interactions.
- When activated, the Sim is temporarily granted the **Chronicler** trait.
- This unlocks all skill book writing options without modifying or replacing EA tunings.

All EA rules still apply:
- A skill book for Skill **X** can only be written from **Skill level 5 in X**
- **Archaeology** books still require **Skill level 8** (EA behavior)

This approach keeps the mod lightweight, compatible, and future-proof.

## Design Philosophy

This mod is **not** an adoption or modification of similar mods.  
It was built from scratch with the clear goal of **not overwriting** existing game resources — a core principle of my modding approach.
