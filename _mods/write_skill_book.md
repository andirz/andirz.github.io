## About This Mod

**Write Skill Book** allows any Sim to write skill books once they meet the required skill levels — without being forced to complete a specific aspiration or permanently override game interactions.

In the vanilla game, only Sims with the **Chronicler (Professorial)** trait can write manuals. This trait is locked behind the *Renaissance Sim* aspiration, which makes little sense from a gameplay perspective. This mod removes that artificial limitation in a clean and non-invasive way.

## How it works?

Sims with **Writing Skill level 5** and **Logic Skill level 2** unlock the **Skill Book Writing** interactions. This mod does **not** overwrite any EA interactions. Instead, it uses a lightweight activation system:

- When activated, the Sim is granted the **Chronicler** trait.
- This trait unlocks all skill book writing options without modifying any EA tunings.

All standard EA rules still apply:
- A skill book for skill **X** can only be written once the Sim reaches **Skill level 5 in X**
- **Archaeology** skill books still require **Skill level 8** (default EA behavior)

This approach keeps the mod lightweight, compatible, and future-proof.

## Design Philosophy

This mod is **not** an adoption or modification of similar mods. It was built from scratch with the clear goal of **not overwriting** existing game resources — a core principle of my modding approach.
