## About This Mod
The **Better Pie Menu** mod is designed to bring order to the chaos of the in-game interaction menus. It provides a significantly better overview of the pie menu structure for a wide variety of objects, including Sims, computers, TVs, stereos, fridges, stoves, mirrors, and more. 

The primary goal of this mod is to speed up your gameplay. By using intuitive and suitable icons, you can find the interactions you're looking for much faster. The restructuring logic decreases the priority of cluttered, unimportant folders while boosting the visibility of essential ones. Additionally, I have introduced several new overarching categories and reorganized sub-folders to create a more logical flow. This mod is fully compatible with the **Base Game**.

The restructuring is handled via a script, so you must **allow script mods** in your game settings for the mod to function. The download archive contains several modules, giving you the flexibility to delete any specific module if you prefer not to have certain objects reorganized.

### Compatibility
Technically, this mod **overwrites** the *Pie Menu Category Tuning* for specific categories. It is important to note that not a single interaction tuning was overwritten, ensuring high stability. 

### Compatibility Guide

#### ✅ No Issues
The following mod has been thoroughly tested and is fully compatible:
* **Smarter Pie Menu** by TwistedMexi

#### ❌ Incompatible
The following mods are completely incompatible and should not be used alongside BPM:
* **Less Main Pie Clutter** by Lumpinou
* **Massage Socials Fix** by Vicky Sims
* **The One With All The Romance** by Katie_mods

#### ⚠️ Significant Compatibility Issues
* **Conversation Tweaks** by Bienchen: This mod overwrites dozens of game interactions. As a result, many of the visual and structural changes intended by BPM may not appear. Due to the sheer volume of changes in Bienchen's mod, I cannot guarantee compatibility or security here.
* **Move, Sort & Hide Interactions** by cLineLy: This mod is currently outdated and its categories may not align with the latest social menu patches. If you wish to use it with BPM, you should use the cheat `cLineLy.enable_default_sortings False` to disable that mod's default sorting.

#### ⚠️ Minor Compatibility Issues 
The following mods do not cause crashes or LE errors, but they may prevent BPM from showing its full range of improvements because they compete for the same menu tuning:
* **Ask Category & Menu Cleanup** by Kuttoe (Socials)
* **Better Meal Time Menu** by LittleMsSam (Kitchen)
* **Carl's Sims 4 Gameplay Overhaul** by Carl (Socials)
* **Complete Cooking Overhaul** by Srslysims (Kitchen)
* **Meaningful Stories** by roBurky (Computer/Fridge)
* **Plumfruit** by Arnie (Computer/Tablets)
* **Realistic Cooking Mod** by Somik and Severinka (Fridge)

In these cases, you will simply see a mix of both mods. There is no urgent need to delete either, but be aware that future updates to these mods could potentially lead to a full conflict.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Problem:** *Since installing the mod, I can't interact with the computer (or other objects). The menu has disappeared, or the game hangs when clicking the object.*

**Answer:** This usually indicates a conflict with another mod that also modifies EA Pie Menus. While these conflicts can be unpredictable, many are fixable. If you encounter this, please let me know which objects are affected and which other mods you are using so I can investigate a resolution.
