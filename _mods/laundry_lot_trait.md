## About This Mod

The new **Self-Service Paid Laundry** lot challenge makes every washing machine and dryer on the lot require payment! Your Sims won’t be able to use them until they **drop in a coin**. Now, your Sims can actively visit a laundromat and wash their clothes in person! You can find this trait in the **Lot Challenges** menu.

### Monetize Your Lots
You can enable this lot challenge on rental lots, university housing, or your own business lot. The lot owner can also **collect the earnings**! 💰 Turn your property into a profitable laundromat and generate passive income whenever other Sims use the machines. 

> **Note:** This feature also works on residential lots, but keep in mind that you will have to pay for using the machines on your own lot, which is essentially paying yourself.

### Compatibility & Testing
This feature has been tested on rental lots, business lots, and university lots. Theoretically, you can apply it to any lot. It also works on public venues, such as parks or gyms, where Sims are charged for using the machines. However, since these lots do not have an owner, nobody can collect the earnings. 

I have not yet tested whether this works on **custom venues** created by other modders. If you try it out, feel free to share your experience!

### Gameplay Focus
To prevent Sims from becoming obsessed with laundry, this mod **does not increase autonomy**. This is designed primarily for **storytellers** and players who want to add financial realism to the washing and drying process.
