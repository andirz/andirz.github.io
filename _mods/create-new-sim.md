## About This Mod
The **Create New Sim** mod unlocks and reorganizes hidden debug interactions, allowing you to spawn new Sims and animals instantly. Originally developed as a testing tool, it is now a powerful utility for players who want to populate their world without going through the CAS process.

Simply **Shift-Click on the floor** in Live Mode to access the new menu.

With just one click, you can create:
* **Humans & Occults:** Quickly add new townies to your current lot.
* **Pets:** Dogs, Cats, and even Foxes (requires *Cats & Dogs* or *Cottage Living*).
* **Livestock:** Horses and small farm animals (requires corresponding Packs).
* **Robots:** Servo and other robotic entities (requires *Discover University*).
