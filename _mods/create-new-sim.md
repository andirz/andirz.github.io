* **Livestock:** Horses and small farm animals (requires corresponding Packs).
* **Robots:** Servo and other robotic entities (requires *EP Discover University*).

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Visual Overhaul:** Reorganized menus with intuitive icons to help you find the right creature type instantly.

## Technical Information

### 🌍 Translations
No separate translations are required! This mod exclusively uses strings already present in the game's code, so it will automatically appear in your game's language (English, German, Russian, Spanish, etc.).

### 🛠️ Requirements
* **Lot51 Core Library** is strictly required for the menu to function.
* **Expansion Packs:** While the mod is Base Game compatible, you will only see options for animals (like Horses or Foxes) if you own the required DLC.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Developer's Note
> "When testing some of my mods, I always needed new 'freshly created' Sims, so I created this mod to save time. It's the perfect companion for anyone who manages large worlds or needs quick test subjects."
