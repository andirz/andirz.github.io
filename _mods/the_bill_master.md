## About This Mod

**The Bill Master** gives Sims alternative (and sometimes questionable) ways to deal with unpaid bills — for those moments when Simoleons are short or morals are flexible.

This mod was originally created by **ShuSanR**. After he announced in February 2022 that he would stop modding and playing *The Sims 4*, I adopted this mod, updated it, and significantly reworked the gameplay to make it more dynamic, risky, and personality-driven.

## Available Interactions

Three new bill-related interactions are added:

- **Hack Into the Tax and Bills Office**  
  Requires **Programming Skill**

- **Pay Bills with a Stolen Credit Card**  
  Requires **Mischief Skill**

- **Ask for Help Paying Bills**  
  Friendly interaction; may fail if the relationship level is too low

## Gameplay Rework & Improvements

### Hack Into the Tax and Bills Office
- Can be attempted from **Programming Skill level 4**
- Success chance depends on multiple factors:
  - Programming skill level
  - University degree in **Computer Science**
  - Lifestyle (Techie / Technophobe)
  - Programming likes & dislikes
  - Focused mood
- **Lucky Potion** (Realm of Magic) slightly increases success chance
- Failed attempts result in different buffs depending on Sim traits
- Interaction moved to the **Hack** menu on computers for better logic and clarity

### Pay Bills with a Stolen Credit Card

- Can be attempted from **Mischief Skill level 5**
- Base success chance: **50%**
- Higher success chance with:
  - Mischief Skill level 9
  - **Kleptomaniac** or **Dastardly** traits
- Higher success chance during **Discount Day** (Seasons), due to overloaded service systems
- **Lucky Potion** (Realm of Magic) increases success chance up to **99%**
- Failure results in the card being blocked and the transaction failing

### Ask for Help Paying Bills
- Currently unchanged from the original version
- Planned to receive additional depth and variability in a future update
