## About This Mod
More realistic gameplay instead of decorative objects! Various decorative objects from the base game and several packs finally function as bottle collectors from which you can actually buy drinks. This mod is now **Base Game Compatible**, but requires specific packs for the actual drinks.

## Supported Objects
The following objects are currently supported and made functional:
* **Base Game:** Bar Display "The Affirmation", Honeycomb Bottle Holder.
* **Get Together (EP02):** The Klassic Juiceback, Illuminated Below Juice Cabinet.
* **Cats & Dogs (EP04):** Happy Juice Barrel, Juice Barrel Holder.
* **Dine Out (GP03):** The Executive Cave Nectar Cooler, Within Reach Nectar Shelf.
* **Horse Ranch (EP14):** Nectar Country Crates (Single & Stacked).

## Functionality
This mod does not contain new meshes. To buy and see drinks, you must own at least one of the following packs:

* **Eco Living (EP09):** Required for Juice Fizzing Bottles.
* **Horse Ranch (EP14):** Required for Nectar Bottles.

If you do not own either of these packs, you will be able to see the interactions on the objects, but you won't be able to purchase any drinks!
