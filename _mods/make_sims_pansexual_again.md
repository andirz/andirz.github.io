## What does this mod do?

After a specific game patch, Sim sexual preferences became more complex, but a bug was introduced: many newly generated NPCs were created as "unromantic" (no interest in men or women), making flirting impossible.

This mod resets and maintains sexual orientations to ensure Sims are pansexual. It affects your active Sims as well as all NPCs (both newly generated and existing ones).

## Mod Variants
The download archive contains two versions. **Please install only one!**

* **Ultimate Version:** Makes **all** Sims (existing & new) pansexual every time the game loads. Any manual changes you make in-game will be reset on the next load.
* **Exploring Version:** Only affects Sims who have the "Exploring: Yes" setting active. Once you manually set a Sim to "Exploring: No," your custom preferences for that Sim will be preserved.

## Key Features

* **Fix for "Unromantic" Sims:** Resolves the issue where new NPCs are generated with zero romantic interests.
* **Automatic Maintenance:** The mod checks Sim settings during every lot load and applies the pansexual configuration based on your chosen variant.
* **Pure Scripting:** This mod is script-based and does not permanently overwrite internal game tunings.

## Requirements & Installation

- **Lot51 Core Library** – Strictly required for the script functionality.
- **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Because this mod actively manages preferences, it should not be used alongside other mods that perform the same task to avoid logic conflicts.

## Translations
No separate translations are needed as the mod does not add any new strings or menu items to the game.

## Developer's Note
> "This mod was created to bring back the gameplay flexibility we had before the sexual orientation changes, while simultaneously fixing the bug that left worlds full of unresponsive NPCs."
