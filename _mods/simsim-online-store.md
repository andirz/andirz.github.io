## About This Mod
The **SimSim Online Store** brings a complete online shopping experience to your Sims. With this mod, Sims can instantly access the online store from computers, laptops, tablets, smart hubs, and mobile phones. Even without an internet connection — or when living *off-the-grid* — shopping is still possible via paper mail. 

Purchased items are added directly to a Sim’s inventory, with no waiting times and no postal delivery required. The mod includes a lightweight account system to manage shopping access, along with an optional *premium membership* that unlocks additional features and conveniences for power shoppers.

## Shopping Assortment
The store includes almost every object from the **Base Game** and **all packs** that can fit into a Sim's inventory.

#### Available Categories
The assortment is organized into numerous departments:
* **Lifestyle:** Wellness & Beauty, Sport & Fitness, Pets & Animals.
* **Home:** Furniture, Home Appliances, Garden & Farming, Plants & Flowers.
* **Tech & Media:** Computers & Hightech, Sound & Music, Books & Magazines.
* **Creative:** Arts & Handicraft, Education & Science, Collections & Decorations.
* **And much more:** Posters, Kids Stuff, Party & Celebration, Beach & Outdoor.

## Special Features
#### Custom Mod Integration
SimSim Online Store supports numerous CC objects from well-known mods, such as:
* **Functional Broom** (Mizore Yukii)
* **Functional Fitness Objects** (Zulf)
* **Home & Land Company** (SimRealist)

Custom objects only appear if the corresponding mods are installed.

#### Shopping Buff System
After making a purchase in the online store, Sims may receive a variety of emotional buffs — ranging from excitement and satisfaction to indifference or boredom. Some reactions are influenced by a Sim’s personality traits. For example, Sims who dislike children may feel bored or unimpressed if they keep buying kids’ items. 

Other emotional responses depend on the situation or are partially randomized, making each shopping experience feel a little different and more personal.
