## About This Mod
The **SimSim Online Store** brings a complete online shopping experience to your Sims. With this mod, Sims can instantly access the online store from computers, laptops, tablets, smart hubs, and mobile phones. Even without an internet connection — or when living *off-the-grid* — shopping is still possible via paper mail. 

Purchased items are added directly to a Sim’s inventory, with no waiting times and no postal delivery required. The mod includes a lightweight account system to manage shopping access, along with an optional *premium membership* that unlocks additional features and conveniences for power shoppers.

## Shopping Assortment
The store includes almost every object from the **Base Game** and **all packs** that can fit into a Sim's inventory.

#### Available Categories
The assortment is organized into numerous departments:
* **Lifestyle:** Wellness & Beauty, Sport & Fitness, Pets & Animals.
* **Home:** Furniture, Home Appliances, Garden & Farming, Plants & Flowers.
* **Tech & Media:** Computers & Hightech, Sound & Music, Books & Magazines.
* **Creative:** Arts & Handicraft, Education & Science, Collections & Decorations.
* **And much more:** Posters, Kids Stuff, Party & Celebration, Beach & Outdoor.

## Special Features
#### Custom Mod Integration
SimSim Online Store supports numerous CC objects from well-known mods, such as:
* **Functional Broom** (Mizore Yukii)
* **Functional Fitness Objects** (Zulf)
* **Home & Land Company** (SimRealist)

Custom objects only appear if the corresponding mods are installed.

#### Shopping Buff System
After making a purchase in the online store, Sims may receive a variety of emotional buffs — ranging from excitement and satisfaction to indifference or boredom. Some reactions are influenced by a Sim’s personality traits. For example, Sims who dislike children may feel bored or unimpressed if they keep buying kids’ items. 

Other emotional responses depend on the situation or are partially randomized, making each shopping experience feel a little different and more personal.

### FAQ

**How do I install the mod?**
Please follow the [general tutorial on mod installation](https://andirz.io/tutorials/installation). Make sure that script files are not placed deeper than one subfolder.

**What are the requirements?**
To function properly, the mod requires both the **PSO Common Package** and the **Smart Core Script**. The Lot51 Core Library is no longer needed.

**Are there known conflicts?**
The mod is designed to be standalone and does not overwrite any game resources. It is compatible with other shopping or delivery mods. Always ensure the required libraries are up to date to avoid issues.

**Why is the selection in the app limited?**
The store adapts to your installed content. If you only have the Base Game, you will see fewer items. As you add more DLCs or supported Custom Content, the assortment will automatically expand.

**Is Custom Content (CC) supported?**
Standard CC objects are often supported and manually added by ID. However, **custom recipes** are currently not supported due to technical limitations and inconsistent tagging by other creators.

**Why is there no mail delivery?**
Items are added directly to your Sim's inventory. Mailbox delivery is technically restricted by the game and would require manual overwrites for hundreds of objects, which is not a priority at this time.

**The interactions are missing – what should I do?**
Check if your Sim has access to a phone, computer, or tablet. If the menu is still missing, ensure the required libraries (PSO Common & Smart Core) are installed correctly and that you are on the latest game version.
