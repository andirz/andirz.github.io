## About This Mod
This mod adds the vampire books and magic tomes to EA's original default ordering interaction on the bookshelves and computers, while also disabling the individual vampire book purchase interactions (if you remember, EA has a separate menu for each volume, which made me very annoying). EA's original requirements that you must reach a certain level of vampire lore skill in order to be able to buy books have been preserved. Magic books are available for everyone in this version.
