## What does this mod do?

Why do all Sims have to want to celebrate their birthday? Why do they always cry when they haven't thrown a birthday party and invited guests? Finally, stop the uniform drama!

**No Forgotten Birthday Drama** replaces the standard "Sad" buff that all Sims receive after a forgotten birthday with multiple buffs and different moods. It brings more individuality to your Sims' reactions, acknowledging that not everyone cares about a party.
