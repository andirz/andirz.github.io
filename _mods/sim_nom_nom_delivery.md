## About This Mod
Introducing the brand-new food delivery app: **Sim-Nom-Nom Food Delivery!** With this mod, you can have your Sims’ favorite food, drinks, and ready-made dishes from bakeries, pastry shops, pizzerias, and restaurants delivered instantly to their inventory. Say goodbye to waiting for couriers or postmen—everything is delivered immediately upon purchase!

Sim-Nom-Nom Food Delivery is available on all devices: **computers, tablets, cell phones**, and even through the **mailbox**. It’s just like the *SimSim Online Store*, but specialized for all your culinary needs. 

**Instant Delivery:** All purchased items are added to the Sim's inventory immediately with no wait time. Give your Sims instant access to a world of delicious treats!

## Further plans
Work on the mod is still continuing. Sim-Nom-Nom Food Delivery does not yet contain a buff, discount, promotion, and gift system (as already exists in SimSim Store). Both mods will be revised in the next updates so that everything works well together. I already have some very interesting ideas here!
