## About This Mod
Many EA objects—especially "outdoor" items like folding chairs, camping lamps, and meditation pillows—look like they should be portable but aren't. This mod dynamically fixes that without overriding a single game file.

## What does this mod do?
It uses a Python-based script injection to fix object behavior on the fly. It is **pack-aware**, meaning it automatically detects which DLCs you own and only applies fixes for the objects present in your game.

## Key Features:
* **Live Drag Support:** Adds the ability to drag objects directly in Live Mode for inventory-compatible items.
* **Portable Enhancements:** Makes chairs and lamps from various packs (and Base Game) portable.
* **Smart Injection:** Zero overrides! It respects EA's recent tuning fixes and only replaces what is still broken.
* **Error Logging:** Automatically creates a log file in your game directory if something goes wrong.

## Upgraded Objects
* **Little Campers Kit (SP33):** Full Live Drag support for all compatible items.
* **Folding Chairs:** Portable versions for chairs from *City Living*, *Get Famous*, *Toddler Stuff*, and more.
* **Portable Lamps:** Small table lamps from *Base Game*, *Get to Work*, and *High School Years* now function as portable lamps (Requires **Discover University**).
