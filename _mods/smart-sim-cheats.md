## Mod Description
**Smart Sim Cheats** provides the fastest and most efficient way to manage your Sims' data. Whether you want to fix a single Sim or perform mass-actions on an entire neighborhood, this mod gives you full control via the **Shift-Click Cheat Menu**.

### 👥 Pick & Choose (Mass Management)
Using the terrain-based picker, you can apply actions to multiple Sims at once:
* **Life States:** Age up/down or reset multiple Sims instantly.
* **Maintenance:** Make them happy, clear their inventories, or add/remove them from the family.
* **Cleaning:** Instantly wipe all visible buffs or traits for a group of Sims.

### 🛠️ Individual Precision
Manually assign or remove almost any data point on a single Sim:
* **Traits & Values:** Personality, Aspirations, Lifestyles, and Character Values.
* **Preferences:** Likes, Dislikes, and hidden preference traits.
* **Occult & Expansion Data:** University degrees, Fame quirks, Werewolf temperaments, Vampire powers/weaknesses, and even Fears.

---

## One-Click Sim Cleaning
Tired of manually clicking away dozens of traits? Use the **One-Click** options to wipe specific categories:
* **Personality & Gameplay:** Clear all traits or specific types.
* **Relationships & Sentiments:** Reset a Sim's social standing entirely.
* **Moodlets:** Remove all visible buffs to reset a Sim's current emotional state.
