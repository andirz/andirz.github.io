## About This Mod

Tired of your Sims all starting to cry at the same time after an unsuccessful holiday, only to stop at the exact same moment as if they were miraculously cured? **No Holidays Failure Drama** puts an end to this robotic behavior!

Instead of a forced, universal "Sad" moodlet for the whole household, this mod introduces individuality and personality to holiday outcomes. Depending on their traits, your Sims will now experience a variety of different emotions with varying durations and intensities.

### New Possible Emotions:
* **Fine**
* **Bored**
* **Sad**
* **Stressed**
* **Tense**
* **Angry**

## Personality Matters
The outcome is no longer random; it is heavily influenced by a Sim's individual characteristics. The following traits are currently integrated:

* **EA Traits:** Gloomy, Cheerful, Party Animal, Hot Headed, Kindness Ambassador, High Maintenance, Clear Perspective, Calming Aura, and Moment Of Clarity.
* **Kuttoe’s Traits:** Stoic, Calm, Perky, and Restless.
* **Vicky Sims (100 Base Game Traits):** Melancholy, Impulsive, Neurotic, Emotional, Joyless, Relaxed, Boring, Optimistic, Well Balanced, High Strung, and Unappeasable.
* **Maplebell’s Traits:** Stoic, Grumpy, Hedonistic, Spoiled, and Pompous.

## Translations
This mod exclusively uses strings already present in the game's code. Therefore, it is **immediately available in all game languages** (English, Russian, German, etc.) without the need for additional translation files.

## Requirements
* **Seasons Expansion Pack (EP05)** is strictly required.
* **Smart Core Script** by Andirz is required for the mod to function.

## Compatibility & Conflicts
This mod modifies how the game reacts to holiday outcomes and may conflict with:
* *No Holiday Outcome Notification* by Bienchen.
* *No More Awful Holiday Sad Moodlet* by Sigma1202.
* *Not Sad About Holidays* by BosseladyTV.

Any other mod that overrides holiday reactions will likely conflict with this mod.
