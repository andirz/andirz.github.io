## About This Mod

**Death Roulette Challenge** is a scenario-focused gameplay mod that introduces a fast, random survival-or-death mechanic for Sims. It is designed for challenge-based storytelling such as war, plague, disaster, or dystopian scenarios. Fate alone decides who survives. With a single interaction, selected Sims will either **die instantly** or **survive the challenge** and receive a positive **Survival buff**.

## Core Features

- Select survival probability: **0%**, **25%**, **50%** or **75%**.
- Up to **8 Sims** can participate in a single Roulette.
- Survivors receive a **happy Survival buff**.
- One-click execution for fast scenario Setup.

> It is not recommended to select too many Sims at once — even the Grim Reaper has limits.

## Eligible Sims

The following Sims can participate:

- Children, Teens, Adults, Elders  
- Occult Sims  
- NPCs on the active lot  
- Pregnant Sims  
- Sims with Immortal traits  

Exceptions
- Ghosts  
- Skeletons  
- Grim Reaper  
- Toddlers (immortal by game design)

Special cases:
- Pregnant Sims can be selected, but if they die, the pregnancy is removed (EA limitation).
- Immortal Sims can be selected; if fate decides death, the immortal trait is removed.

## Death Logic

Deaths are handled using **Base Game–compatible methods**:

- Default death: **Starvation**
- During rain: **Lightning** (EP05 Seasons)
- Vampires, Spellcasters, and Robots die according to their species
- Children die by **fire** (the only valid EA child death type)

## Access & Usage

Because of the nature of this mod, the interaction is only available via the **Cheat Menu**  
(hold **CTRL** to access it).
