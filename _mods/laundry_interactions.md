## About This Mod

The **Laundry Interactions** mod expands the gameplay of *Laundry Day Stuff* by adding a variety of new, realistic, and sometimes humorous interactions to laundry objects. Originally part of the *Laundry Service* mod, these features have been separated and significantly expanded to provide more depth for clean-obsessed Sims and storytelling.

Whether you're looking for more realism or just a bit of chaos, these new options will breathe fresh life into your Sims' chore routines. Have fun with it!

### Laundry Pile
* **Instantly Clean Clothes** (Cheat)
* **Fold Up Clothes**
* **Re-Wash Clean Laundry**
* **Smell the Laundry** (with unique buffs)

### Folded Stack
* **Instantly Clean Clothes** (Cheat)
* **Mess Up Laundry**
* **Re-Wash Clean Laundry**
* **Smell the Laundry** (with unique buffs)

### Hamper
* **Transfer Laundry** to the Sim’s inventory
* **Fold Dirty Laundry** directly from the hamper
* **Replace the Stinky Laundry Bag**
* **Spray Freshener** on empty hampers
* **Smell the Hamper** (with unique buffs)
* **Re-Wash Clean Laundry** from the hamper
* **Fill Hamper with Dirty Laundry** (Cheat)
* **Vomit in the Hamper** (requires certain conditions)

### Washing Machine
* **Instant Upgrade** (Cheat)
* **Turn On/Off** (manually reset machines if they become stuck)
* **Add Fragrance Additive**
* **Re-Wash Clean Laundry**
* **Undress and Wash Clothes** (perfect for non-residential venues)

### Dryer
* **Instant Upgrade** (Cheat)
* **Run Another Dry Cycle**

Many of these new interactions are perfect for **storytelling**, especially for your **clean-obsessed Sims**. Additionally, all cheat interactions that were previously limited to laundry piles are now available directly on the hamper. I’ve also reorganized the cheat category into clearer groups for better navigation.

Enjoy the cleaner (or messier) gameplay!
