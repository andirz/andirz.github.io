## What does this mod do?

This mod is a texture replacement that swaps EA’s default body hair textures with high-quality textures created by **Luumia**. It aims to provide a more realistic and aesthetic look for your Sims, as the original game textures are often considered lacking in detail.

### Key Features:
* **Texture Overhaul:** Replaces arm, leg, back, and chest hair with Luumia's renowned v5+ textures.
* **Smart Color Mapping:** Since EA offers 24 colors but textures are more limited, colors have been mapped logically (e.g., green-haired Sims receive blonde body hair for a natural look).
* **Base Game Compatible:** Enhances the body hair system added in the base game patches.

## Mod Variants
There are two versions available. **Please install only one!**

* **Men Only Version:** Restricts all body hair to Male Sims only. Women remain completely hairless.
* **Also Women Version:** Allows Women to have light body hair for legs and arms. Back and chest hair remains disabled for female Sims, and medium/heavy growth stages are turned off to maintain a subtle look.

## Technical Details & Limitations
* **Simplified Selection:** This is a replacement mod, not a standalone CC pack. It replaces the specific number of textures EA uses (3 levels for arms/legs/back, 6 combinations for chest/stomach).
* **Uniform Style:** To ensure randomly generated Townies look consistent, straight hair textures were used rather than mixing different hair types.
* **Child Safety:** The "hairless" chest hair replacement has been adjusted to ensure no accidental texture bleed-through (such as pubic hair) occurs on children.

## Compatibility
This mod replaces internal game resources and will conflict with any other mod that overwrites EA body hair textures, such as:
* *No Female Body Hair* by YourFalseHope
* *Disable all body hairs for female sims* by Zordard

## Credits
Original textures by **Luumia**. These textures were adjusted and modified in accordance with Luumia's Terms of Use.
