## About This Mod

**Auto Service Career** is a full remake and modernization of the original *Auto Service Career* by **YouLie**, originally published on ModTheSims. The original mod had not been updated since mid-2019 and was no longer functional. It also missed many gameplay systems introduced with later expansions such as **Discover University**, **High School Years**, **Growing Together**, lifestyles, and other modern mechanics.

With permission from the original author, this mod was fully adopted, repaired, and expanded. All images used in the career still belong to the original creator.

## Career Overview

This is a classic **rabbit hole career** focused on hands-on automotive work.

Most career levels are based on the original mod, but many aspects have been adjusted or rebalanced:
- Working hours  
- Work outfits  
- Promotion requirements  
- Salary levels  

Because this is not an academic profession, no university degrees are required for promotion. Progression is instead driven by relevant skills, making the career more immersive and logical.
