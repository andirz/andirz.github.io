## About This Mod
**Smart Core Script** is a dedicated technical library for **The Sims 4**. It is not a standalone gameplay mod and does not add any visible features on its own. Instead, it acts as a shared foundation — the internal “engine” that many of my other mods rely on. By moving complex and reusable functionality into this core library, I can keep individual mods lighter, more stable, and easier to maintain. It also ensures better compatibility between my projects, since they all operate on the same underlying systems.

This download consists of a standalone script library. The included package file contains only localization data for menus and system messages.

### Why is this required?
If you’re viewing this page, chances are you’re installing one of my gameplay mods. Those mods depend on Smart Core Script to handle advanced features that the base game cannot provide on its own. Without this library installed, those mods will simply not function.

> **Important:** You only need to install this library if a mod’s requirements specifically state that it is required! If you don’t use any of my core-dependent mods, you don’t need this file in your folder.

## Key Features
* **Engine Extensions:** Adds vital script injections and logic that are missing from the original game engine, enabling complex mod features.
* **Version Validation:** Automatically checks if the script is outdated and notifies you to ensure your game stays stable after patches.
* **Optimized Performance:** Built for efficiency with minimal impact on game loading times and frame rates.
* **Config System:** Allows you to save your own settings in dedicated config files. Your preferences remain safe even after mod updates.
* **Centralized Logging:** Provides a unified error reporting system, making it easier to diagnose and fix conflicts.
