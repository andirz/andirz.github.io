## About This Mod

**Extended Private Journal** expands the diary journal with new interaction groups focused on
skill development, emotional reflection, and storytelling.

This mod was originally created by **ShuSanR**. After he announced in February 2022 that he would stop modding and playing *The Sims 4*, I adopted the idea, fully rewrote the code from scratch, updated it for current game versions, refined the design, and added new gameplay features.

## Main Features

The private journal now includes several new interaction categories:

- **Practice Skills** – controlled skill development through diary-based activities  
- **Positive Emotions** – influences positive Life Skill development  
- **Negative Emotions** – may negatively influence Life Skills  
- **Confess Secrets** – emotional storytelling interactions with buffs

## Life Skills

Life Skill interactions affect **Children and Teens**, influencing:

- Responsibility  
- Manners  
- Empathy  
- Conflict Resolution  
- Emotional Control  

For **Adult Sims**, these interactions no longer affect Life Skill progression but can still apply emotional buffs and are useful for storytelling.

Menu names may differ between children and adults and are subject to change.

## Practice Skills

Selected diary-based skill activities are available.  
Not all skills are included intentionally — this mod is **not** meant to be a generic skill grinder.

Available practice interactions (Child to Elder):

- **Practice Writing** – Writing (Base Game)  
- **Create Sketches** – Painting (Base Game)  
- **Write Jokes** – Comedy (Base Game)  
- **Solve Math Problems** – Logic (Base Game)  
- **Prepare for Debate** – Research & Debate (**Discover University – EP08**)  

For children, Mental and Creativity skills are developed instead.

## Confess Secrets

The journal includes a new **Confess** category for personal reflections:

- **Fears** – Base Game  
- **Wedding Fantasy** – Base Game  
- **Romantic Memory** – Base Game  
- **Wants / Wishes** – requires **Snowy Escape (EP10)**  

These interactions provide emotional buffs only and do not affect skills or Life Skills, making them ideal for storytelling.

If a required pack is not installed, the corresponding interaction will simply not appear.
