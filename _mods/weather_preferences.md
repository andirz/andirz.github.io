## What does this mod do?

Normally, your Sims' weather preferences (for sun, rain, snow, and wind) are hidden from you as "hidden traits." This mod makes those existing preferences visible by visualizing them as **Likes** and **Dislikes** traits in the UI.

**Note:** This mod does not add new gameplay mechanics; it only reveals what is already present in your Sim's data.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Patch 1.108+

Since the 1.108 game patch, the way custom likes and dislikes work has changed significantly. 

To see these weather preferences in your game, you **must** have Zerbu's **Custom Preferences Mod** installed. Without Zerbu's mod, you will not see the weather preferences, and using custom likes/dislikes mods alone may cause an infinite loading screen or prevent CAS from opening.

## Requirements

* **The Sims 4 Seasons (EP05)** – Required for weather traits.
* **Zerbu's Custom Preferences Mod** – Strictly required to visualize the traits in the UI.

## Compatibility

This mod overwrites the original hidden traits from the game. It will conflict with any other mod that modifies the same trait resources.

**Known Conflicts:**
* **Unhidden Traits** mod by Chingyu (specifically the *Visible Weather Preferences* add-on).
* **PrefPlus** mod by Helaene (specifically the *Weather, Season and Holiday* add-on).

*To resolve these conflicts, simply remove the specific add-ons mentioned above while keeping the rest of those mods.*

## Translations

The mod includes built-in strings for:
* **English**
* **German**
* **Spanish**
* **Russian**
* **French** (translated by Mollory)

All other language versions will default to English.
