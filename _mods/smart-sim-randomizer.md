## Mod Description
The **Smart Sim Randomizer** brings life to your world by automatically and intelligently assigning preferences and traits to both active Sims and NPCs. Unlike basic randomizers, this mod uses "intelligent filling" to ensure that assigned traits make sense based on a Sim's existing personality.

### 🧠 Smart Logic
The randomization isn't just a dice roll; it's a probability-based system:
* **Trait Synergy:** A *Snob* Sim is unlikely to enjoy cheap furniture.
* **Skill Matching:** A *Creative* Sim is more likely to enjoy painting.
* **Consistency:** If a Sim hates cooking, they will likely hate baking too.
* **Occult Awareness:** Vampires prefer the dark, while Mermaids love the rain.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Likes & Dislikes
Upon appearing in the game, Sims receive a balanced set of preferences covering:
* Characteristics & Conversation Topics
* Activities, Colors & Music Genres
* Fashion & Décor
* **Bonus:** Supports custom preferences like *Pizza* (Kuttoe) and *Animals* (ChippedSim).

### 2. Hidden Preferences & Values
Automated generation also affects:
* **Movie Genres & Weather:** Based on traits (e.g., Romantics love Romance movies).
* **Life Choices:** Umbrella usage, eating with chopsticks vs. forks, political positions.
* **Character Values:** Automatically assigns values from *EP Parenthood* to YA, Adults, and Elders (if they don't have them yet).

### 3. Manual Control & University Degrees
Shift-click any Sim to access the **Cheat Menu**:
* **Toggle Automation:** Disable randomization for specific Sims using the "No Auto Randomness" trait.
* **Instant Assignment:** Re-roll all preferences or character values with one click.
* **University Degrees:** Generate "Fake" (no skills) or "Real" (with skills) degrees intelligently.
