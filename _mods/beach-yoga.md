## What does this mod do?

This mod was previously part of another project and has been slightly updated and released as a standalone mod for better visibility and maintenance.

- Yoga mats can be used **as beach towels**
- Fully integrated into existing yoga interactions
- No custom UI and no custom strings

## Important Notice – Beach Towel Game Bug

Due to a current EA bug, beach towels are not fully functional in the game.

To use this mod properly, you **must** install the **Beach Towel Fix** by Bienchen.  
For convenience, the fix is also provided here as a separate download.

Full credit goes to Bienchen for identifying and resolving this issue.

## Compatibility

No compatibility issues are expected.  
This mod does not override any game resources.
