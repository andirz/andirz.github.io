## What is this?
The **Smart Core Script** is a technical library and **NOT a standalone mod**. It serves as the "engine" for many of my other projects. 

> **Important:** You only need to install this library if a mod's requirements specifically state that it is required (e.g., for the *SimSim Online Store*).

## Requirements
To ensure the script works correctly, you must enable script mods in your game settings:
1. Open **Game Options** in The Sims 4.
2. Go to the **Other** tab.
3. Check the boxes for **Enable Custom Content and Mods** AND **Script Mods Allowed**.
4. Restart your game.

## Compatibility
This is a standalone script library. It does not override any game files (tuning or internal code), so there are **no known compatibility issues** with other mods or game updates. The included package file contains only the translations for menus and system messages.

## Translations
The Smart Core Script is localized for a global community. If your game is set to one of these languages, the menus will appear automatically:

* **English, German, Spanish, Russian:** Provided by Andirz.
* **Brazilian Portuguese:** Translated by Nymphieta.
* **Chinese (Traditional & Simplified):** Translated by Orchard Team.
* **Italian:** Translated by vale93_games.

### For Modders & Users
If you are using one of my mods and notice that custom menus (like the SimSim Store or special pie menus) are missing, please ensure that you have the **latest version** of this Core Script installed in your Mods folder.
