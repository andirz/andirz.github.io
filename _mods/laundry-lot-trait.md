## What does this mod do?

The **Laundromat Service** mod introduces the "Self-Service Paid Laundry" lot trait (found under Lot Challenges), which makes all washing machines and dryers on the lot require a fee to operate.

* **Paid Usage:** Sims must pay before they can use the machines, allowing you to create functional laundromats where Sims wash their clothes in person.
* **Passive Income:** If your Sim owns the lot (Rental, Business, or University lots), they can collect the earnings generated whenever other Sims use the machines.
* **Versatile Application:** While designed for rentals and businesses, it can be applied to any lot, including public venues like parks or gyms.

## Gameplay Details

- **Owner Earnings:** Lot owners can actively collect the money accumulated in the machines. 
- **Residential Use:** You can use it on residential lots, but your own Sims will have to pay as well (essentially paying themselves).
- **Autonomy:** To prevent Sims from becoming obsessed with laundry, this mod does not add extra autonomy; it is focused on storytelling and economic realism.

## Requirements

* **Laundry Day Stuff (SP13)** pack is required.
* **Lot51 Core Library** is strictly required for the payment and ownership logic.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.
