## About This Mod
The **Smart Sim Randomizer** brings life to your world by automatically and intelligently assigning preferences and traits to both active Sims and NPCs. Powered by the independent **Smart Core Script** framework, this mod uses “intelligent filling” to ensure that assigned traits make sense based on a Sim’s existing personality.

### Customizable Configuration System
Version 3.0.0 introduces a groundbreaking framework that gives you absolute control through a new in-game interface:
* **In-Game Menu:** Forget about manual file editing or restarting the game to test settings. You can now access a dedicated menu to change all configuration options directly in real-time.
* **Granular Targeting:** You decide the scope of the mod's influence. Choose exactly who is affected by the automation—whether it is the **Active Household only**, **Unplayed NPCs** to keep your townies fresh, or **All Sims** for a fully dynamic world.
* **Safety First:** To ensure your carefully crafted Sims aren't changed without your consent, all settings are **turned off by default**. The mod remains dormant until you explicitly enable the specific categories you want to randomize.
* **Persistent Settings:** Your configuration is automatically saved as an `.ini` file within your **"Save" folder**. This means your custom rules, limits, and preferences remain intact even after mod updates, game patches, or a complete reinstallation of the mod files.

### The Smart Logic
Unlike basic randomizers that just roll a dice, this framework uses a probability-based system that respects a Sim's existing identity, appearance, and history. The mod analyzes a Sim's traits to derive character-driven choices: for example, a *Snob* is unlikely to enjoy cheap furniture, while a *Creative* Sim is more likely to enjoy painting. This ensures logical consistency—if a Sim hates cooking, they will likely hate baking too—and the more skills a Sim possesses, the more accurately their randomized preferences will match their unique identity.

The system also "sees" your Sim's physical appearance for deeper world-building: the clothes a Sim wears when they first appear directly influence their favorite colors and fashion styles. This creates a seamless "Color Sync," where a Sim who likes red is automatically assigned a red umbrella. This logic extends to "Attraction Mapping," linking romantic attraction to personal taste—Sims are naturally drawn to the hair colors, outfits, and styles they already prefer for themselves.

Furthermore, the mod is fully aware of a Sim’s occult status and personal history. Vampires instinctively prefer dark colors and have an aversion to the sun, while Mermaids have a higher probability of loving the rain and water activities. There is even a built-in "Trauma-Check" for Ghosts, allowing for specific randomization blocks based on their cause of death.

## Supported Properties
When enabled in the configuration, the mod intelligently manages a vast array of Sim properties across multiple gameplay systems. This includes:
* **Likes & Dislikes:** Activities, Colors, Music Genres, Décor, Fashion, Characteristics and Communication Topics.
* **Turn-Ons & Turn-Offs:**: Hair Color, Outfit Color, Fashion Styles, Characteristics, Romance Styles, and Way of Life.
* **Hidden Preferences:** Weather, Movie Genres, Political Positions, Umbrella Choices, Utensil Preference, and even opinions on Mayonnaise.
* **Infant & Toddler Preferences:** Baby Feeding Preferences, Infant Food Prefferences, Carriers Preferences.
* **Other Values**: Parenthood Character Values, Fears and Infant Quirks.
