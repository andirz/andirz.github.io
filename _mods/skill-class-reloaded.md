A complete rework of the standard skill classes in *The Sims 4*. This mod adds personality to the learning experience, fixes long-standing bugs, and improves the overall interaction.

### Key Features

* **Bug Fix (The "Rabbit Hole" Fix):** Fixes an EA bug that often prevented Sims from entering the building. Sims will now properly attend classes for the full 105-minute duration.
* **Realistic Registration:** You can now only register for courses **until 8:00 PM**. This prevents the EA issue where you could pay for a class at 8:50 PM only for it to fail immediately because classes cannot start after 9:00 PM.
* **Better Accessibility:**
    * **Children can now attend skill classes** (fixing an EA oversight).
    * Base price reduced from 250 to **100 Simoleons**.
    * **50% Discount** for Children, Teens, and Elders.
* **Emotional Learning:** Sims gain an **additional skill boost** if they attend a class while **Focused, Energized, or Inspired**. They are also more likely to return from class in a good mood.
* **Improved Skill Picker:**
    * Removed incorrectly displayed horse-related skills.
    * Added clear **category icons** for easier navigation.

### Note on Custom Skills (CC)
Skills are sorted by categories at the tag level. If a custom skill from another modder does not appear in a specific category, it is likely because the necessary tags were not provided by the creator. These skills can always be found in the **"Show All"** category.

### Requirements
* **Discover University** Expansion Pack is required.
* **Smart Core Script** (v. 2.2.0 or higher) is required for full functionality.
