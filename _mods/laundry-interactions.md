## What does this mod do?

The **Laundry Interactions** mod expands the gameplay of *Laundry Day Stuff* by adding a variety of new, realistic, and sometimes humorous interactions to laundry objects. Originally part of the *Laundry Service* mod, these features have been separated and significantly expanded to provide more depth for clean-obsessed Sims and storytelling.

### New Features by Object:

* **Laundry Pile:** * Fold Up Clothes and Re-Wash Clean Laundry.
    * Smell the Laundry (includes custom buffs).
    * Instantly Clean Clothes (Cheat).
* **Folded Stack:** * Mess Up Laundry, Re-Wash, or Smell the Laundry.
* **Hamper:** * Transfer laundry to inventory or fold dirty laundry directly from the hamper.
    * Replace stinky bags, spray freshener on empty hampers, or even vomit in the hamper (under certain requirements).
    * New Cheat category for filling or emptying the hamper.
* **Washing Machine & Dryer:** * Add fragrance additives, undress and wash clothes (for non-residential venues), and run additional dry cycles.
    * Toggle power on/off to fix "unusable" machines.
    * Instant Upgrade cheats.

## Requirements

* **Laundry Day Stuff (SP13)** pack is required.
* **Lot51 Core Library** is required for the menu and logic systems.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Translations

* **English, German, Spanish, and Russian** – by me.
