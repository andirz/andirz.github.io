## About This Mod

Too busy to do the laundry? Does washing and drying take up too much time? The **Soapy Llama Laundry Service** mod has you covered! 

This mod introduces new interactions for laundry baskets, laundry piles, and folded stacks, allowing your Sims to send their dirty laundry to a professional laundromat for a fee. Once the cleaning time has passed, the clothes will be returned directly to your Sim’s inventory.

This mod was originally developed by **ShuSanR**. After he stopped modding in February 2022, I adopted and fully revised the implementation, including a complete rebrand to "Soapy Llama."

## Main Features

Your Sims can choose from three convenient service levels:

* 🧺 **Standard Wash** – Takes around 2 hours (Clean & Dry).
* ⚡ **Express Wash** – Takes around 1 hour (Clean & Warm).
* 🌿 **Delicate Wash** – Takes around 3 hours (Pristine, Warm & Fragrant).

### How it works:
* Functions are available on **hampers**, as well as **scattered and folded laundry** (both in the world and in the Sim's inventory).
* Cleaned clothes are returned to the **Sim's inventory** after the service time has passed.
* Cheat interactions have been moved to a separate mod for a cleaner experience.

## Requirements

* **Laundry Day Stuff (SP13)** pack is strictly required.
* **Lot51 Core Library** is required for full functionality.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Translations

* **English, German, Spanish, and Russian** – by me.
* **Italian** – by vale93_games.
* **Polish** – by Aarathiel.
* Other strings were translated using ChatGPT for initial support.

## Compatibility

* **No Overrides:** The mod does not overwrite any game resources.
* **Standalone:** All interactions are added independently.
* Compatible with other laundry-related mods, such as the *Laundromat Service Lot Trait*.
