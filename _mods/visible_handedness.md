## About This Mod

This override mod makes the hidden handedness of your Sims visible! Technically, it overrides the corresponding hidden traits and converts them into gameplay traits that appear in the Sim's UI.

This mod does not add any additional interactions; it simply visualizes the handedness (Left-Handed or Right-Handed) that is already assigned to your Sim by the game.

## Compatibility

This mod overwrites the original **Handedness** hidden traits from the game. It will conflict with any other mod that modifies the same hidden trait resources.
