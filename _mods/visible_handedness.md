## What does this mod do?

This override mod makes the hidden handedness of your Sims visible! Technically, it overrides the corresponding hidden traits and converts them into gameplay traits that appear in the Sim's UI.

**Note:** This mod does not add any additional interactions; it simply visualizes the handedness (Left-Handed or Right-Handed) that is already assigned to your Sim by the game.

## History
This is a standalone version of one of my older mods. It was originally part of *Smart Sim Cheats* before being separated into its own project for better maintenance and visibility.

## Key Features

* **Visualized Traits:** Easily see if your Sim is left-handed or right-handed directly in their trait panel.
* **Lightweight Override:** Only modifies the specific trait resources needed for visibility.
* **Base Game Compatible:** Works perfectly without any Expansion or Game Packs.

## Requirements

* **Base Game** – No additional packs required.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Compatibility

This mod overwrites the original **Handedness** hidden traits from the game. It will conflict with any other mod that modifies the same hidden trait resources.

## Translations

No translations are needed! The mod does not contain any new text strings as it relies on existing game data.

## Developer's Note
> "Whether a Sim is left-handed or right-handed usually has no impact on gameplay other than the animation, but I always felt it was a detail worth seeing at a glance."
