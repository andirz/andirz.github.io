## About This Mod

I believe different mods shouldn't stay isolated but should be integrated into the common gameplay. This mod adds various new elective courses to both universities, including forgotten EA skills and custom skills from popular community mods. Each course concludes with either a final exam or a written assignment; no presentations are included.

**Notes:**
- ⭐ No EA university course existed for this skill before  
- 🔞 Adult content (not available on CurseForge)  
- 🆕 Recently added content 

## Modular Installation
The archive is split into several modules. **Please read carefully and delete the versions you do not want!**

### 1. Cost Variants
You must choose one cost variant for your courses:
* **Standard Costs:** Courses cost 240 Simoleons (matching default EA courses).
* **More Costs:** Courses are more expensive (matching Zero's University mods).

### 2. Skill Categories
The files are organized by skill type so you can keep only what you use:
* **EA Skills** (requires corresponding Packs)
* **Custom Skills** (requires third-party mods)
* **Adult Skills** (Basemental/WickedWhims - available separately on Patreon/Nexus)

> **Important:** Do not install course files for third-party mods you do not have installed. Removing a mod or a course file while a Sim is currently enrolled in that specific class may cause loading errors.

## Compatibility
This mod is fully compatible with Zer0's University Custom Degrees mod.
