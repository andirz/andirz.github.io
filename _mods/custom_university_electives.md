## What does this mod do?

I believe different mods shouldn't stay isolated but should be integrated into the common gameplay. This mod adds various new elective courses to both universities, including forgotten EA skills and custom skills from popular community mods.

**Custom University Electives** is fully compatible with Zer0's *University Custom Degrees* mod. Each course concludes with either a final exam or a written assignment; no presentations are included.

## Supported Skills (35 Total)

The mod includes courses for the following skills, categorized by their source:

### EA Skills (Previously Unsupported)
* **Juice Fizzing** (Eco Lifestyle)
* **Fabrication** (Eco Lifestyle)
* **Medium** (Paranormal)
* **Retail Sales** (Get To Work)
* **Entrepreneur** (High School Years)
* **Rock Climbing, Skiing, & Snowboarding** (Snowy Escape)
* **Nectar Making** (Horse Ranch)

### Popular Custom Skills
* **Archery, Ballet, Harp, Harpsichord, & Oboe** (by Jane Simsten)
* **Cosmetics Crafting & Dairy Production** (by Pied Piper)
* **HVAC** (by Lot 51)
* **Psychic Power, Religion, & Romance** (by Lumpinou)
* **Language Skills** (by Frankk)
* **Realistic Swimming** (by Ilkavelle)
* ...and many more.

## Modular Installation
The archive is split into several modules. **Please read carefully and delete the versions you do not want!**

### 1. Cost Variants
You must choose one cost variant for your courses:
* **Standard Costs:** Courses cost 240 Simoleons (matching default EA courses).
* **More Costs:** Courses are more expensive (matching Zero's University mods).

### 2. Skill Categories
The files are organized by skill type so you can keep only what you use:
* **EA Skills** (requires corresponding Packs)
* **Custom Skills** (requires third-party mods)
* **Adult Skills** (Basemental/WickedWhims - available separately on Patreon/Nexus)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not install course files for third-party mods you do not have installed. Removing a mod or a course file while a Sim is currently enrolled in that specific class may cause loading errors.

## Requirements & Compatibility
* **The Sims 4 Discover University (EP08)** is strictly required.
* **Lot51 Core Library** is required for full functionality.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Translations

* **Portuguese (Brazilian):** by Nymphieta.
* **Chinese (Traditional & Simplified):** by Wanzi & Orchard Team.
* **Partial/Google Translate:** Dutch, French, Italian, Polish, and Norwegian.

## Developer's Note
> "I created this to bridge the gap between expansion packs and the modding community. Why shouldn't your Sim be able to get a university credit for learning Archery or Nectar Making?"
