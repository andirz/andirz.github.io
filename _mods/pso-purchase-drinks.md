More realistic gameplay instead of decorative objects! Various decorative objects from the base game and several packs finally function as bottle collectors from which you can actually buy drinks. This mod is now **Base Game Compatible**, but requires specific packs for the actual drinks.

## What does this mod do?
It transforms static, decorative bottle racks and cabinets into functional dispensers. Instead of just looking at them, your Sims can now interact with them to purchase bottled beverages directly into their inventory.

### Supported Objects
The following objects are currently supported and made functional:
* **Base Game:** Bar Display "The Affirmation", Honeycomb Bottle Holder.
* **Get Together (EP02):** The Klassic Juiceback, Illuminated Below Juice Cabinet.
* **Cats & Dogs (EP04):** Happy Juice Barrel, Juice Barrel Holder.
* **Dine Out (GP03):** The Executive Cave Nectar Cooler, Within Reach Nectar Shelf.
* **Horse Ranch (EP14):** Nectar Country Crates (Single & Stacked).

## Requirements & Functionality
> **Important:** This mod does not contain new meshes. To buy and see drinks, you must own at least one of the following packs:

* **Eco Living (EP09):** Required for Juice Fizzing Bottles.
* **Horse Ranch (EP14):** Required for Nectar Bottles.

If you do not own either of these packs, you will be able to see the interactions on the objects, but you won't be able to purchase any drinks!

## Translations
This mod uses existing in-game strings. Therefore, **no separate translation files** are required; it will automatically appear in your game's language.

## Compatibility
This mod does not overwrite any internal game tunings or objects. It adds functionality via script, so no compatibility issues are to be expected.

## Technical Requirements
* **Smart Core Script:** Required for functionality.
* **P.S.O. Common Package:** Required.
* **Game Settings:** "Script Mods" must be enabled in the game options.
