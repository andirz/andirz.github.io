This library contains **common resources** (icons, images, tests, and shared settings) used across the *Purchasing System Overhaul* (PSO) series.

## What is this?
The P.S.O. Common Package acts as a central resource hub. You don't need to download this unless another mod (like *SimSim Online Store*) explicitly requires it.

**Important Update (v2.0+):** The custom script has been removed to avoid conflicts. This mod now relies entirely on the **Smart Core Script**, which must be installed separately!
