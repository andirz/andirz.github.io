The **Smart Core Script** is the backbone of my modding ecosystem. It provides the essential logic, engine extensions, and configuration tools required for many of my advanced mods to function correctly.

## Key Features

* <i class="fas fa-vial" style="color: #2563eb; margin-right: 8px;"></i> **Engine Extensions:** Adds vital script injections and logic that are missing from the original game engine, enabling complex mod features.
* <i class="fas fa-bell" style="color: #2563eb; margin-right: 8px;"></i> **Version Validation:** Automatically checks if the script is outdated and notifies you to ensure your game stays stable after patches.
* <i class="fas fa-gauge-high" style="color: #2563eb; margin-right: 8px;"></i> **Optimized Performance:** Built for efficiency with minimal impact on game loading times and frame rates.
* <i class="fas fa-file-settings" style="color: #2563eb; margin-right: 8px;"></i> **Config System:** Allows you to save your own settings in dedicated config files. Your preferences remain safe even after mod updates.
* <i class="fas fa-clipboard-list" style="color: #2563eb; margin-right: 8px;"></i> **Centralized Logging:** Provides a unified error reporting system, making it easier to diagnose and fix conflicts.

## Technical Details
This script does not contain any gameplay content on its own. It is a **library** used by other mods. You only need to install this once in your main Mods folder (no deeper than one subfolder).

## Developer Note
If you are a modder interested in using the Smart Core functions for your own projects, stay tuned for documentation or contact me via Discord.
