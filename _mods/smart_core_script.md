## What is this?
The **Smart Core Script** is a technical library and **NOT a standalone mod**. It serves as the "engine" for many of my other projects. **Important:** You only need to install this library if a mod's requirements specifically state that it is required!

{% include script_notice.html %}

## Compatibility
This is a standalone script library. It does not override any game files (tuning or internal code), so there are **no known compatibility issues** with other mods or game updates. The included package file contains only the translations for menus and system messages.
