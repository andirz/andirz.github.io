## What does this mod do?

Normally, your Sims' favorite movie genres are hidden as "hidden traits." This mod overwrites these traits to make them visible gameplay traits in the UI. 

**Note:** No new gameplay is added; the mod simply visualizes what is already present in the game. To give you full control, a new cheat menu is added to every TV, allowing your Sims to choose or change their favorite genre at any time.

## Key Features

* **Visibility:** Hidden movie preferences are now visible in the Sim's trait panel.
* **Cheat Menu:** Shift-click (or use the new menu) on any TV to manually set a favorite genre for your Sim.
* **Immersive Storytelling:** Easily track if your Sim prefers Action, Horror, Comedy, Romance, or Family movies.

## Requirements

* **The Sims 4 Movie Hangout Stuff (SP05)** – Strictly required for the movie traits.
* **Lot51 Core Library** – Required for the menu functionality.
* **Script Mods** must be enabled in your game settings.

## Compatibility

This mod overwrites specific hidden traits from the game. It is **not compatible** with any other mods or add-ons that modify the following trait resources:
* `trait_Hidden_FavoriteMovie_Action` (ID: 128970)
* `trait_Hidden_FavoriteMovie_Horror` (ID: 128971)
* `trait_Hidden_FavoriteMovie_Comedy` (ID: 128972)
* `trait_Hidden_FavoriteMovie_Romance` (ID: 128973)
* `trait_Hidden_FavoriteMovie_Family` (ID: 128974)

## Translations

No separate translations are required! The mod exclusively uses strings already present in the game's code, so it will automatically appear in your game's language.
