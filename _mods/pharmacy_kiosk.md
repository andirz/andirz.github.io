## What does this mod do?

Do you no longer want to buy medicine online but want a real place for your Sims to go? This mod is designed for players who love storytelling or more realistic gameplay. It adds a custom **Pharmacy Kiosk** object to your game.

The kiosk is a modified version of the university pack kiosks and comes in two styles:
* **Modern Version:** Perfect for a contemporary city or hospital setting.
* **Antique Version:** Great for historic neighborhoods or charming old towns.

## How to find it
You can easily find the kiosks in Build Mode by searching for the keywords **“kiosk”** or **“pharmacy”**.

## Important Functional Note
By default, this kiosk is a **purely decorative object**. To turn it into a functioning vendor with shopping interactions and custom animations, you will need to install the **Purchase Medicine** mod. That mod adds the "Purchase Medicine" interaction directly to this object.

## Requirements

* **The Sims 4 Discover University (EP08)** – Required for the original kiosk meshes.
* **Purchase Medicine Mod** (Optional but Recommended) – Required to make the kiosk functional.

## Translations

The object names and descriptions are available in the following languages:
* **English, German, Spanish, Russian** (by Andirz)
* **Brazilian Portuguese** (by Nymphieta)
* **Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)** (by Wanzi & Orchard Team)
* **Italian** (by vale93_games)
* **French** (by Mollory)

## Developer's Note
> "I created this object specifically for those who felt that medicine was a bit too easy to get. Walking to a kiosk to pick up an antidote or cold medicine adds that extra layer of 'Sims-life' that I love."
