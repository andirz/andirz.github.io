## About This Mod

Do you no longer want to buy medicine online but want a real place for your Sims to go? This mod is designed for players who love storytelling or more realistic gameplay. It adds a custom **Pharmacy Kiosk** object to your game.

The kiosk is a modified version of the university pack kiosks and comes in two styles:
* **Modern Version:** Perfect for a contemporary city or hospital setting.
* **Antique Version:** Great for historic neighborhoods or charming old towns.

You can easily find the kiosks in Build Mode by searching for the keywords **“kiosk”** or **“pharmacy”**.

## Important Functional Note
By default, this kiosk is a **purely decorative object**. To turn it into a functioning vendor with shopping interactions and custom animations, you will need to install the **Purchase Medicine** mod. That mod adds the "Purchase Medicine" interaction directly to this object.

## Language & Translations

The object names and descriptions are available in the following languages:
* **English, German, Spanish, Russian** by me
* **Brazilian Portuguese** by Nymphieta
* **Chinese** and **Simplified Chinese** by Wanzi & Orchard Team
* **French** by Mollory
* **Italian** by vale93_games
