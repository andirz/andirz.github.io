## About This Mod
**Obscura Network** is not just a dark web—it’s a mystical world governed by its own rules. To access it, your Sims will need to dig deep into the internet, uncover hidden information, and unlock the gateway. But beware: Obscura does not tolerate recklessness.

Sims with a low **Obscura Skill** level are at the mercy of the network’s punishments. Carelessness may lead to more than just viruses or computer breakdowns—it could result in something far more sinister. Rumor has it that the network can drain a Sim’s energy or plunge them into a deep slumber. 

**The Network is Watching:** The previous *Dark Web Skill* and *Rough Area* items from SimSim Online Store have been completely reworked and moved here. Obscura is now a standalone experience with its own perils and rewards.

## Main Features

* **The Black Market:** Buy forbidden and rare goods that you won't find anywhere else.
* **Risk & Reward:** High chance of running into viruses, scammers, or even police surveillance.
* **New Minor Skill:** Obscura Network Skill (5 levels) to master the dangers.
* **New Fear:** Fear of Obscura—a psychological toll for those who fail.

## Compatibility
This mod does not overwrite any game files, so no compatibility issues are to be expected.

## Feedback
Many features are still in their early stages of development. I would love to hear from you:
* Do negative effects occur too often or too rarely?
* Which specific effects have you observed in your game?
* Have you encountered any bugs or police interactions?
